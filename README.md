# Colin "Vindexus" Kierans
I am a full stack web developer who works on personal projects, businesses, and games.

## Preferences
My preferred stack to build with is a Go backend with Postgres, and a React/TypeScript frontend. I tend to use NodeJS instead of Go, but I'd love to get back into more Go.

## Hobbies
I also enjoy Dungeon World. You can view the [moves by Colin Kierans](http://moves.vindexus.net/) I've written here.
